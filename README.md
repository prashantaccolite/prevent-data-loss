# PreventDataLoss

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.0.

## How To Start

1) Fork and Clone
2) Run `npm i`
3) Run `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Task

1) Integrate form with `Reactive` 
2) No need to integrate validation
3) Add routing links in `Header` (active and block)
4) `Fill the data` in the form and `without submit`, hit the `block` link. in this case a `confirmation popup` should come with a message `Are you sure you want to leave the page`. on `Yes` page will redirect and on `Cancel` page will not redirect. 
5) If form is blank, in that case no need to show confirmation popup
6) We have to achieve this functionality with `CanDeactivate`
